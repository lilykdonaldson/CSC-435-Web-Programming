    <h3 id ="spring">Spring</h3>
    <p>
     A true Seasonal Color Analysis SPRING is the most delicate but vivid of all the seasons, a beautiful bright fresh color palette.
    <br>
    If you fit comfortably into this category your natural coloring is glorious and you have a wonderful mix of characteristics - WARM, LIGHT and BRIGHT.
    <br>
    Each of the beautiful shades in the SPRING color palette has the same Color Characteristics as your own, to complement your natural coloring and create harmony!
    <br>
    When you're wearing colors that echo your natural coloring your skin and eyes will be clearer and blemishes will be minimized. A natural bloom will appear; the right make-up will enhance this even more.

    <h3 id ="summer">Summer</h3>
    <p>
      Seasonal Color Analysis SUMMER is probably the prettiest of all the color palettes. The deliciously delicate tones of an English country garden. 
      <br>
      As the fresh and warm tones of Spring give way to the sleepy days of Summer, the colors become soft and dreamy, seen through a 'heat haze'. If your color characteristics are LIGHT, COOL and SOFT then these are the colors for you.
      <br>
      Nothing brash, just elegant and feminine. The SUMMER colors will allow you to re-create your natural coloring in the clothes and makeup that you wear so creating Color Balance. 
    </p>
    <h3 id ="autumn">Autumn</h3>
    <p>
      Is this your Color Palette? Do these colors feel LIKE YOU? A true Seasonal Color Analysis AUTUMN is the most elegant and sophisticated of all the color palettes.
      <br>
      As Summer fades into Autumn glory, the colors become soft and rich, warm and blended. The Autumn shades can be heavy on some people, but on you they look CLASSIC and ELEGANT, RICH and EXPENSIVE! If your color characteristics are Warm, Deep and Muted then these are the colors for you.
      <br>
      The AUTUMN color palette allows you to re-create your natural coloring in the clothes and makeup that you wear. This creates COLOR BALANCE and harmony!
    </p>
    <h3 id ="winter">Winter</h3>
    <p>
      A true Seasonal Color Analysis Winter is the most stunning of the Seasonal color palettes.
      <br>
      As the dewy, warmth of Autumn color gives way to the keen winds of the year's end, the colors become CLEAR and BOLD - STRONG and ICY!
      <br>
      The Winter palette is made up of 3 color families - COOL DEEP and BRIGHT. 
      <br>
      You will always have a blue undertone to your skin and strong clarity to your coloring, i.e. high contrast.  
      <br>
      Beautiful Megan Fox has almost a porcelain complexion and a very obvious blue undertone to her skin giving a pink toned complexion.
